Competitive programmers spend hundreds and thousands of hours practicing programming problems and participating contests.
Vjudge has been an amazing platform for participating/hosting programming contests and problem-solving.

However, there can be scenarios where you'd like to add vjudge solutions to the actual judge profiles specifically.
I personally felt the need of it along with some of my friends and colleagues.
It's a tiresome job to submit all the solved problems of vjudge to the actual judges. This here is a small approach to get such works done easily.

Current solution will only work for **UVa**, **CodeForces**, **LightOj** and **SPOJ**. 
So far, it's pretty much stable and working just fine. It's roughly written and tested. But hey, it works!!!

With enough response and your contribution I hope to add some more judges here as well. Huge thanks to all who contributed so far to my fun projects.

Let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/feedbacks or simply if you liked it.

Hope you enjoy. <3

## Installation Guide:
### With poetry(Easier):-
1. Download/clone the repository from github using git:-
   * Run `git clone https://github.com/m-s-abeer/vjudge-to-oj.git` from your cmd/terminal in your specified directory.
1. Download and install `python ^3.10` from here:- https://www.python.org/downloads/
1. Make sure you are using the desired python version by running `python --version`
1. Download and install `python-poetry`
   * Linux, MacOS, WSL:- `https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer`
   * Windows(powershell):- `(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -`
   * If none of the above worked or to know more:- https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer
1. Get inside project `vjudge-to-oj` and then write `poetry install` on cmd/terminal. This should install all the dependencies/packages.

### Without poetry:-
1. Download/clone the repository from github using git:-
   * Run `git clone https://github.com/m-s-abeer/vjudge-to-oj.git` from your cmd/terminal in your specified directory.
1. Download and install `python ^3.10` from here:- https://www.python.org/downloads/
1. Make sure you are using the desired python version by running `python --version`
1. Get inside project `vjudge-to-oj`
1. Write `python -m venv .venv` to create a python environment inside project. 
1. Write `source ./.venv/activate` for Linux, MacOS, WSL. For windows write `.\.venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the python environment
1. Run `pip install --upgrade pip` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies/packages

### Set your .env file:-
1. Create a file named `.env` in the project directory.
1. Copy the contents of `.env.example` and paste it in `.env` file.
1. Read the comments in `.env` file and set the values accordingly.

## How it should work:
1. Complete the #installation-guide and run the following command inside project root from cmd/terminal to activate the environment:-
   * Poetry users: `poetry shell`
   * Linux, MacOS, WSL users: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
   * Windows users: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Make sure you have set the values in `.env` file correctly.
3. Run `python main.py` from the project root
4. The program will automatically download your Accepted solutions from vjudge and then submit them one by one and store the submitted solutions to another folder(modules>Submitted>UVA>).
5. It'll show you the status report as it runs. It may look messy, but it actually helps you see what's going on.
* No login data is bypassed/redirected to anywhere else. Vjudge login data is stored inside "vjudge-to-oj>modules>cookies" this directory. You can empty that folder if you're concerned or have issues logging in.

**N.B: Please don't run it when the corresponding judge is already busy and many submissions are already in queue. It's built only for personal uses. This program is in no way meant to hamper the solving environment of a judging platform.**
